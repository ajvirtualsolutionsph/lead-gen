# CLAUDE.md

## When the User Types "123" (End-of-Session Save)

Run this sequence in order, without asking:

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** — Replace `### ✅ Done` with 3–5 bullets from this session only. Replace `### 🔲 Next Session` with 2–3 bullets for what's next. Keep both sections short.
2. **Update memory file** — Rewrite `memory/project_lead_gen_status.md` with current pipeline state, last actions taken, and next priorities.
3. **Commit + push** — Stage all changed files, commit with a message starting with today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD:` format (e.g. `2026-05-07: add follow-up logic`), then push to `origin/main`.
4. **Chat report** — Reply with a summary covering: what files were updated, total leads across all tabs, what was committed, and what the next priority is.

This is the end-of-session save trigger. Execute all four steps every time "123" is typed.

### ✅ Done

- Updated `format_sheets.py` to use dark charcoal header (`#3C4043`) with white bold text
- Added alternating row banding across all 4 tabs via Sheets API `addBanding`
- Iterated row colors to subtle cool gray (`#E8E9EA`) alternating with white — black text preserved
- Added banding deduplication logic to prevent duplicate bands on re-runs

### 🔲 Next Session

- Import new leads — New Leads tab is still empty (0 leads)
- Type `draft email` once new leads are added
- Run `python format_sheets.py` anytime to re-apply formatting after sheet changes

## Chat Triggers (run from Claude — no terminal needed)

| Phrase | Command |
|---|---|
| "draft email" | `python draft_agent.py --yes` |
| "send initial email" | `python send_emails.py --initial --yes` |
| "send follow up" | `python send_emails.py --followup --yes` |

When the user types any of these phrases, run the corresponding command via Bash, show full output, and report results.

---

## When the User Says "Run the Project"

Always run this sequence first, before responding or asking anything:

1. `python organize_sheets.py`
2. `python status_report.py`
3. Show full output of both scripts
4. Ask: "What would you like to do next?"

The report is only accurate after step 1. Show raw output before commentary.

## Commands

```bash
python draft_agent.py          # Draft emails for new leads
python send_emails.py          # Send initial + follow-ups (run from Windows Terminal)
python send_emails.py --initial
python send_emails.py --followup
python organize_sheets.py      # Refresh tabs (run after any send)
python status_report.py        # Show pipeline state
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Pipeline

Full lifecycle: **add leads → draft → send initial → 5 days → follow-up → 2 days → no reply**

| Tab | Rule |
|---|---|
| **New Leads** | `sent` is empty |
| **Initial Email Sent** | `sent` filled, no other tab applies |
| **Needs Follow Up** | `sent` filled, 5+ days old, follow-up drafted, `followup_sent` empty |
| **Ready for Call** | `followup_sent` filled, 2+ days passed |

Priority order: Ready for Call → Needs Follow Up → Initial Email Sent → New Leads.

Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zq7muXisE8QywVGXtRE6OqyDRl84UKWy37HoorjxO3s

Fill in: `name`, `business_name`, `category`, `address`, `phone`, `website`, `email`, `rating`, `review_count`, `notes`, `details` — leave all other columns blank.

## Architecture

**`draft_agent.py`** — reads rows where `status != "drafted"`, calls Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), parses `SUBJECT:` / `EMAIL:` / `FOLLOWUP:` from response, writes back with `status = "drafted"`.

**`send_emails.py`** — sends initial emails (`sent` empty) and follow-ups (`sent` filled, `followup_sent` empty). Saves `thread_id` + `message_id` for Gmail threading. No email → sets `sent`/`followup_sent` to `SKIPPED_NO_EMAIL`.

**`sheets.py`** — central read/write module. Sheet ID in `.env` as `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`.

**Threading** — follow-ups sent as Gmail thread replies via `threadId` + `In-Reply-To`/`References` headers. Leads without `thread_id` send as new threads.

**Email rendering** — plain text → HTML, URLs auto-linkified, Gmail signature appended, subject title-cased.

### Gmail OAuth
- `gmail_credentials.json` — from Google Cloud Console
- `gmail_token.json` — auto-generated; delete to force re-auth
- Scopes: `gmail.send`, `gmail.readonly`, `gmail.settings.basic`, `spreadsheets`, `drive.file`

### `.env` keys
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GMAIL_ADDRESS`, `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Gmail auth popup doesn't appear | Delete `gmail_token.json`, re-run |
| "Scopes have changed" error | Delete `gmail_token.json`, re-run |
| Module not found | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Draft agent fails | Check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` |
| Sheet not found | Check `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in `.env` |
